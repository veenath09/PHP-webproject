                <h2>Sabi Sand Game Reserves, South Africa</h2>
                <p>Sabi Sand Game Reserve offers excellent wildlife viewing. This is especially true of the big cats. All of the Big Five are usually seen in a two to three-day visit. Off-road driving assures quality sightings, particularly of the habituated resident predators. Sabi Sand is part of the vast Greater Kruger ecosystem, which makes for a very authentic wildlife experience.Sabi Sands is possibly the best place in Africa to see leopard. Both the quantity and quality of sightings is superb. This is a place where you can see leopard behavior such as males marking and patrolling their territory or females interacting with their cubs. Wild dog sightings are less common, but if they are denning in the area, it is often possible to spend time with these social pack animals.</p>

                <h2>Yala National Park, Sri Lanka</h2>
                <p> Yala combines a strict nature reserve with a national park. Divided into 5 blocks, the park has a protected area of nearly 130,000 hectares of land consisting of light forests, scrubs, grasslands, tanks and lagoons. Two blocks are currently opened to the public.

                    Situated in Sri Lanka’s south-east hugging the panoramic Indian Ocean, Yala was designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1900 and was designated a national park in 1938. Ironically, the park was initially used as a hunting ground for the elite under British rule. Yala is home to 44 varieties of mammal and 215 bird species. Among its more famous residents are the world’s biggest concentration of leopards, majestic elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, peacocks, and crocodiles. The best time to visit Yala is between February and July when the water levels of the park are quite low, bringing animals into the open.</p>

                <h2>udawalawe National Park, Sri Lanka</h2>
                <p> Udawalawe is an important habitat for Sri Lankan elephants, which are relatively hard to see in its open habitats. Many elephants are attracted to the park because of the Udawalawe reservoir, with a herd of about 250 believed to be permanently resident.The Udawalawe Elephant Transit Home was established in 1995 for the purpose of looking after abandoned elephant calves within the park.[3] A total of nine calves, on two occasions in 1998 and 2000, with another eight calves in 2002, were released in the park when old enough to fend for themselves.

                    The rusty-spotted cat, fishing cat and Sri Lankan leopard are members of the family Felidae present in Udawalawe. The Sri Lankan sloth bear is seldom seen because of its rarity. Sri Lankan sambar deer, Sri Lankan axis deer, Indian muntjac, Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain, wild boar and water buffalo are among other mammal species</p>

                <p> WNP spans across the Puttalam and Anuradhapura districts, and borders the Mannar and Vavuniya Districts. The area is one of the most important elephant habitats in the country and is also a great place to observe the elusive Sri Lankan leopard and the sloth bear.

WNPs landscape comprises of dry zone forests and thorny scrub interspersed with extensive open plains, sand dunes and the unique Villu wetlands. Bare reddish cliffs rising abruptly from narrow beaches of the Portugal Bay and Dutch Bay are another striking feature of its landscape.
                    
                    WNP is in the proximity to the ancient historical city of Anuradhapura and houses several ancient ruins and artifacts from various periods of history.</p>
