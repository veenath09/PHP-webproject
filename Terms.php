                <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
                <h3>Terms of Use</h3>
                <p>These terms of use – that may be amended at our discretion – apply to all our services that are provided to you online directly or indirectly. By browsing our website, making use of our website and/or making a reservation through our platform you acknowledge and agree that you have read the below terms of use and you agree to these terms of use. We advise you to carefully read the terms of use, so you fully understand the rights and obligations you have in relation to your use of the platform.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Payment & Refund Policies</h3>
                <p>Your use of the Platform is free of charge. Organizers charge their own fees for the Experience Offers. Please be aware that you might owe the Organizer (part of) the fee in case you make a Reservation. We have no influence on, are not involved in and are not liable for your payment of Reservations.<br>
                When using the Platform, you will be able to convert the prices of Experience Offers to the available currencies. Such converted prices are indicative. At the moment of payment, the price of the Experience Offer will be converted in real-time to the currency as specified by the Organizer. This amount may differ from the amount displayed at an earlier moment. The price displayed after such real-time conversion will be the amount you are due for the relevant Reservation. The Platform can demand payment in the national currency of the user and the foreign currency claim can be converted based on the current exchange rate at the time the contract is concluded. The Platform can charge the user a suitable conversion charge for this.<br>
                Since the Organizers are responsible for the payments terms, you cannot derive any rights from the currencies or payment methods available at a certain moment. Furthermore, Tripaneer is not responsible for and has no influence on the applicable payment terms.</p>
                <br>
